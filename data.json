From there, David will teach you about inheritance and polymorphism. This video tutorial also covers advanced features, such as implementing core syntax, subclassing built-ins, and new style classes. You will also learn about exceptions and object serialization. Finally, David will teach you about efficiency and testing, including debugging, logging, and benchmarking.",
